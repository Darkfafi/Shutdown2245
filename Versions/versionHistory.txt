V7:
* Fixed immediate shutdown when starting computer past given time or when timer started past given time.
* Changed minimum time to 2 minutes.
* Fixed spam of debug shutdown popup.

V6:
* Added new terminal / shortcut commands;
	- safe=60 // Safe Time in minutes to which you can edit the time. If you edit the timer after the end time minus the safe minutes, the computer shuts down (If 0 it is disabled) (0 by default)
	- debug=0 // Adds debug features when flagged 1, such as shutdown message instead of actual shutdown process. (0 by defaut)

V5:
* Added Next Day Checkbox which gives the user the choice if given time is for today or the next day
* Fixed issue with notification not triggering if already triggered, timer stopped and then started again.
* Renamed all the command prompt / shortcut commands to full words;
	- h -> hours
	- m -> minutes
	- s -> seconds
	- n -> notification
	- p -> position
	- i -> screen
	- a -> start

	- tomorrow=0 // If the time applies for the current day or the next (default 0) (0 or 1 boolean) 

V4:
* Formatted and Refactored code (clean  use of already given variables for view items and bundled methods)
* Added new terminal / shortcut commands;

    - a=1 // Auto start timer (default on 1, acts as Boolean 0 or 1)
* Fixed time picker display bug
* Fixed timer starting at 00:00:00 bug

V3:

    - h=24    // Target Hour
    - m=55    // Target Minute
    - s=55    // Target Second
    - n=30    // Notification time in minutes
    - p=0.5    // X position normalized (between 0 - 1)
